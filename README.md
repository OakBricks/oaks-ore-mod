PFAQ (Possible Frequently Asked Questions)


Q: FORGE NOWWWWWWW!!!! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ˜³

A: If you want ðŸ…±ORGE so badly then port it your self, Forge is not as dev-friendly as Fabric (and ðŸ…±orge is the Windows 10 of Minecraft Modding)

Q: Why

A: I want to contiune the long-known OakBricks tradition of making shitty mods (started on MCreator, ended up on actual code!) for minecraft

Q: Is there a coding style

A: YES! check out the CONTRIB.md file for more info

Q: If i make a port of this mod to Forge, what do i need?

A: This is gonna be a list (going to be a list)
1. Permission from me (or just make a public github fork of this mod for your port)
2. Testing, i dont want a fake mod that will ruin the name of this already ruined mod (take the fake Lithium Forge for example)
3. Stability, i want a working stable Forge mod that wont crash when put into a big modpack (also pls make it work with optifine+shaders!!!!)

Q: I want to update this mod to a snapshot version, but i dont feel good about opensource since it is run by commies!!!!

A: fux you, i aint no commie, joe mom is commi!!!
